# EldenLord
Memory game with theme of Elden Ring Video Game. 

This is a project that implements the fundamentals of web development, to create a game that uses memory of the user to click on cards and try to get matches in the least amount of tries. 
Using Javascriot to create interactions through the appending of elements to the DOM and using event listeners. Buttons were added to express when the game starts and when to restart the game.
